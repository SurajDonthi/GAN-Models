# Implementation of Several GAN Models with flexibility to easily develop and prototype GAN architectures.

This is a clean, extensible and lightweight framework built on pytorch-lightning for training and evaluating GAN models. It comes with 6 GAN models out of the box.

The models available out-of-the-box are:
1. GANs
2. DCGAN
3. Improved & BadGAN
4. Conditional GANs
5. Wasserstein GANs
6. CramerGANs
